# php-wq-beanstalkd

This package contains the PHP class
`mle86\WQ\WorkServerAdapter\`**`BeanstalkdWorkServer`**.

It supplements the
[**mle86/wq**](https://github.com/mle86/php-wq) package
by implementing its `WorkServerAdapter` interface.

It connects to a Beanstalkd server
using the [pda/pheanstalk](https://github.com/pda/pheanstalk) package
by Paul Annesley.


## Installation

The package's name on Packagist is
[**`mle86/wq-beanstalkd`**](https://packagist.org/packages/mle86/wq-beanstalkd).

```
$ composer require mle86/wq-beanstalkd
```


# Class reference

`class mle86\WQ\WorkServerAdapter\`**`BeanstalkdWorkServer`** `implements WorkServerAdapter`

`getNextQueueEntry()` uses the `RESERVE` command,
`buryEntry()` uses the `BURY` command,
`storeJob()` and `requeueEntry()` use the `PUT` command,
and `deleteEntry()` uses the `DELETE` command.

*Work Queues* are Beanstalkd's “tubes”.

* `public function` **`__construct`** `(string $host = "localhost", int $port = PheanstalkInterface::DEFAULT_PORT, int $connectTimeout = null)`  
    See [Pheanstalk::__construct](https://github.com/pda/pheanstalk/blob/master/src/Pheanstalk.php).


# Usage example

```php
<?php
use mle86\WQ\WorkProcessor;
use mle86\WQ\WorkServerAdapter\BeanstalkdWorkServer;

$processor = new WorkProcessor( new BeanstalkdWorkServer("localhost") );

while (true) {
    $processor->executeNextJob("mail");
}
```

This executes all jobs available in the local Beanstalkd server's “`mail`” tube, forever.
It will however abort if one of the jobs throws an exception –
you might want to add a logging try-catch block around the `executeNextJob()` call
as shown in [WQ's “Minimal Example”](https://github.com/mle86/php-wq#minimal-example).
